There was a time during and shortly after highschool when I was so obsessed with sudoku puzzles. I'd try solving any puzzle I came across, some  in newspapers some on my phone. But there was always those hard ones which I couldn't figure out, and it used to frustrate me. 

My first attempt at solving my problem was to create this [{SudokuR}](https://github.com/kennedymwavu/SudokuR-pkg) package. I was quite satisfied since I created it from scratch (Not like invented the whole universe but the logic is all mine).

I tried creating a shiny app then but I just couldn't figure out where to start. So I set out to learn shiny. Got a job in the process and became entangled with it. 

Months later I scroll down my GitHub repos only to find this as one of the million unfinished projects (Yes, there are many others!). At this point it feels like a toy project (maybe it is, after all) but I just decided to get it done.

Here is a list of the packages I've used to develop this application:
* [{sudoku}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sudoku/index.html) to 
generate and solve the sudokus.

* [{shiny}](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [{shinydashboard}](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) and [{shinydashboardPlus}](https://rinterface.github.io/shinydashboardPlus/) for UI layout.

* [{fresh}](https://dreamrs.github.io/fresh/articles/fresh.html) for the dashboard theme.

* [{rhandsontable}](https://jrowen.github.io/rhandsontable/) for the sudoku boards.

* [{shinycssloaders}](https://github.com/daattali/shinycssloaders) to show loading animations.

* [{markdown}](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for creating this tab contents.

* **My Creativity**


Might add more features soon!
